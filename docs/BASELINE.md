# monitoring_system Performance Baseline

**Phase**: 0 - Foundation and Tooling
**Task**: 0.2 - Baseline Performance Benchmarking
**Date Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Infrastructure Complete - Awaiting Measurement

---

## Executive Summary

This document records the performance baseline for monitoring_system, focusing on the overhead of monitoring operations on the monitored system. The primary goal is to ensure monitoring adds < 1% overhead.

**Baseline Measurement Status**: ⏳ Pending
- Infrastructure complete (benchmarks implemented)
- Ready for measurement
- CI workflow configured

## How to Run Benchmarks

```bash
cd monitoring_system
cmake -B build -S . -DMONITORING_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./build/benchmarks/monitoring_benchmarks
```
